# Hackathon & Presentation Kit

This folder now separates prep material into two focused docs:

- [HACKATHON_PITCH_SCRIPTS.md](HACKATHON_PITCH_SCRIPTS.md) — talking points, on-stage script, 1-minute/3-minute pitches, demo flow, style variants, 6-slide outline, closing and fallback lines.
- [HACKATHON_JUDGE_QA.md](HACKATHON_JUDGE_QA.md) — judge Q&A cheat sheet for technical, governance, and reliability questions.

Suggested prep order:

1. Read [HACKATHON_PITCH_SCRIPTS.md](HACKATHON_PITCH_SCRIPTS.md)
2. Practice transitions and fallback lines
3. Drill [HACKATHON_JUDGE_QA.md](HACKATHON_JUDGE_QA.md)
