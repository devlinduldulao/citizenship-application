# Security Policy

Security issues are taken seriously in this project.

## Supported versions

The `main` branch is the actively maintained branch. Security fixes are prioritized there.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for suspected vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository (Security Advisories / "Report a vulnerability") and include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Impact assessment (what can be exploited)
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Suggested remediation, if available

If private reporting is unavailable in your environment, contact repository maintainers through a private channel and reference this policy.

## Disclosure process

- We acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible.
- We triage severity and impacted components.
- We work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing.
- We publish remediation guidance when a fix is available.

## Scope reminders

When reporting, please include whether the issue affects:

- Backend API/authentication/JWT handling
- Frontend token/session behavior
- Docker/deployment configuration
- OCR/NLP processing pipelines

Thanks for helping keep the project and community safe.
